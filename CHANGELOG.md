# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-07

First public release.

- Administrator authentication with random initial credentials, password hashing and session validation.
- Streaming HTTP/gRPC-Web and WebSocket gateway with an IDE management overlay.
- Separate per-profile runtime directories and credentials, with a shared conversation library and indexes.
- Explicit switch/start/enter flow, manual diagnostics and automatic checks after OAuth/launch.
- Visible abnormal results with possible causes, including region and account eligibility failures.
- HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy support, authentication bridge and batch link import.
- Browser CSP privacy restrictions, external redirect blocking, IP-header removal and per-profile browser storage.
- Independent core installation/uninstallation, profile import/export and configuration editing with backups.
- Runtime OAuth registration lookup from an installed compatible official client, with private configuration/environment overrides; no bundled client secret.
- Linux CI across Python 3.9, 3.11 and 3.14, deployment examples and public-tree checks.

Known limits: shared history paths depend on Antigravity versions; profile directories are not OS tenant sandboxes; browser policy does not control other apps; server proxy enforcement is not a network-level firewall. Google authorization/region eligibility is outside this project's control.
